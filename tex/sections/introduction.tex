\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Teaching humans new assembly operations can be a long and error prone process
	\item Maintenance of complex and expensive products requires reading extensive manuals
	\item Cooperative assembly between an human operator and a robotic system needs an intuitive exchange of information
	\item Quality control and error correction in assembly lines can be faster by using augmented reality systems for helping the operators remove / repair the affected parts
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Assisted assembly is a multidisciplinary area that combines 3d perception with augmented reality in order to assist the operator performing complex tasks faster and with less mistakes
\end{itemize}
