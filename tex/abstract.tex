Teaching complex assembly and maintenance skills to human operators usually requires extensive reading and the supervision of experienced tutors. In order to reduce this training period and avoid the need of human supervision, we developed an immersive teaching system capable of guiding unexperienced operators performing complex assembly, repair or maintenance operations. The system provides textual and video instructions for each step and allows the operator to navigate between the teaching steps and control the video playback (pause, play, seek) using a bare hands natural interaction interface that is projected into the workspace. Moreover, to help the operator during the final validation and inspection phase, the system can also project the 3D outline of the expected final product after performing 6 DoF object recognition using a feature matching approach followed by dense point cloud registration for pose refinement. The teaching system was tested with the assembly of a starter motor and proved to be more effective and intuitive than reading the traditional user manuals. Moreover it allowed to reduce the training time while also providing a more enjoyable experience for the operator, which reduces the cognitive fatigue after the training sessions and increases the overall productivity.
