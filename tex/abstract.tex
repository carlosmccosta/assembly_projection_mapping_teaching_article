Teaching complex assembly and maintenance skills to human operators usually requires extensive reading and the help of tutors. In order to reduce the training period and avoid the need of human supervision, an immersive teaching system was developed for guiding inexperienced operators. The system provides textual and video instructions for each step and allows the operator to navigate between the teaching steps and control the video playback using a bare hands natural interaction interface that is projected into the workspace. Moreover, to help the operator during the final validation and inspection phase, the system projects the 3D outline of the expected final product. The proposed teaching system was tested with the assembly of a starter motor and proved to be more effective and intuitive than reading the traditional user manuals. This prof-of-concept use case served to validate the fundamental technologies and approaches that were proposed to achieve an intuitive and accurate augmented reality teaching application. The most technically challenging problem was how to properly model and calibrate the projection hardware along with the estimation of the object's poses for achieving precise overlap between the 3D rendered content and the physical world. On the other hand, the conceptualization of the information flow and how it can be conveyed on-demand to the operator was also of critical importance for ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for the operator.
